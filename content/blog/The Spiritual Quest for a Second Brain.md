> Listen carefully, my son, to the master’s instructions, and attend to them with the ear of your heart. (Rule of St. Benedict, Prologue)

In his book "Digital Minimalism", Cal Newport emphasises the importance of solitude, which he defines as a "subjective state in which your mind is free from input from other minds". But why is a book about productivity talking about an ancient spiritual discipline? "When you avoid solitude", Cal writes, "you miss out on the positive things it brings you: the ability to clarify hard problems, to regulate your emotions, to build moral courage, and to strengthen relationships". It is interesting that the deprivation of solitude not only affects your productivity but also your whole being. However, reading this passage from "Digital Minimalism" made me realise that our current search for productivity is, in fact, a spiritual aspiration.

Another giant in the productivity world is Tiago Forte and his book "Building a Second Brain". The "second brain" theme has sprawled over several branches, such as the Zettelkasten method, digital gardens, and software like Obsidian and Roam Research. The promise is that, if you store your thoughts correctly, creating a "perfect memory", you will achieve productivity nirvana. This is similar to the dream that AI one day will be able to replace you in all your menial human tasks, leaving your time to be dedicated to higher aspirations, "and ye shall be as gods".

These perfect networked systems inevitably fail, of course. The fact that our brain operates as a network does not imply that it is desirable or even possible to represent our thoughts in a similar manner. All of our attempts to forcibly transcend human limits, trying to get to heaven by building bigger and bigger towers, are doomed to fail, and the only healthy way of dealing with this is by accepting it. What we need isn’t a second brain, but rather to think deeply, engaging in rational contemplation, spending time in solitude.

Time, by the way, is perhaps the central word in this topic. After all, productivity is about managing time, and all of these aspirations to a superhuman type of existence suggest that our sense of time is broken. This implies not only that we are incapable of developing a healthy relationship with productivity, but also that we are unable to find meaning. Meaning requires narrative, and narrative requires time.

One could argue that religion is a form of organising time. Religion gives us a collective memory that inspires our actions in the present, rituals that give us a necessary pause and direction in the chaos of reality, all of that neatly packed in a liturgical calendar. In religious communities, spiritual mentors help the less experienced ones by giving advice on disciplines to practice, and even how to organise one's planner to spend time in contemplation. In our corporativist world, however, we exchanged spiritual mentors for productivity coaches.

But what is the fundamental difference between spirituality and personal productivity? The most successful productivity method, "Getting Things Done" or "GTD", describes "Horizons" at which we should look to plan our lives. These horizons plan life as if it were a corporation, with its visions and goals. In contrast to this, the monks of the old proposed a "Rule of Life", which, instead of giving us short, mid and long-term goals, orients our lives towards something eternal, beyond the hype and waves of our current time.

> For all of us, prayer must be regular, not haphazard, not erratic, not chance. At the same time, it cannot be routine or meaningless or without substance. Prayer has to bring beauty, substance and structure to our otherwise chaotic and superficial lives or it is not long before life itself becomes chaotic and superficial. A life of spiritual substance is a life of quality. (The Rule of Benedict: Insights for the Ages by Joan Chittister, OSB)
